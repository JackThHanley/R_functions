# The R package 'collections' does offer nice container types, but can seem fairly sticky to use for R users

# Creating a pseudo-dictionary in is a useful tool if you want to reference the list entries by name rather than an
# arbitrary indexing.

# Ex. Lets say the entries to a pseudo_dict are 'A', 'B', and 'C' with entries of '1', '2', and '3'. To get
# the corresponding value for 'A', simply call pseudo_dict['A'] to get a return of '1'!

# The idea of this function is to create a pseudo_dict in R,
# similar to the functionality of a Python dict. In R, this relies on
# the list() object.

# Feel free to change around the names of the inputs/name of the function once
# you copy into R!


# Assumes both keys and values are vectors (and are of equal length)

# Default filling is integers

# Keys and values must line up

# You can order your pseudo_dict the keys by using the order() and names() functions

# Ex. dict[order(names(dict))] will return a now ordered dictionary




# FUNCTION

pseudo_dict <- function(keys, values){
  if(missing(values)){
        
        i <- 1
        
        LIST <- list()
        
        while(i <= length(keys)) {
            LIST[i] <- i
            i <- i + 1
        }
        
        names(LIST) <- keys
        
        return(LIST)
        
  } else{
    
        i <- 1
        
        LIST <- list()
        
        while(i <= length(keys)) {
            LIST[i] <- values[i]
            i <- i + 1
        }
        
        names(LIST) <- keys
        
        return(LIST)    
    
  }
